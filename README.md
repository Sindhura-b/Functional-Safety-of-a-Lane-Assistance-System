# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System



This project is about constructing part of a safety case for lane assistance system. Analyzing and documenting system safety is critical for autonomous vehicle development. Safety plan/assessment begins with hazard analysis and risk assessment and then creating documents for functional safety, technical safety, hardware and software safety requirements. 


### Description of 5 stages of functional safety

The entire process of developing a safety concept for a safety critical lane assistance system involves creating documents for:

Safety plan: This document provides overall framework for lane assistance item from safety point of view. It also assigns the roles and responsibilities of each person involved in developing safety case for lane assistance item.

Hazard analysis and risk assessment: Hazard analysis involves identification of hazards/unsafe conditions that could occur due to implementation of lane assistance system in a vehicle. Risk assessment is done in terms of level of severity, controlability and exposure and an ASIL rating is assigned by following ASIL chart specified by ISO26262. 

Functional safety concept: In this document high-level safety goals are further refined. Each functional safety requirement is then allocated to it's appropriate place in item architecture.

Technical safety concept:Technical safety concept describes how the systems communicate at the message level and how the ECUs communicate with each other.

Software requirements and architecture: This document details requirements and metrics against which the item can be verified that will enusre its functional safety.
